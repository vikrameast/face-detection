Face detection program created using Python and the OpenCV library. In this repository, the uploaded photo is of Michael Phelps, however you can upload any other image and change the file name in line 5. When you run the program, if there is a face in the uploaded image, it will save a file in the current directory called 'face_detected.png'. The image will show a blue box around the detected face
